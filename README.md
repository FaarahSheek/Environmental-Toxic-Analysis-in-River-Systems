#EnvironmentalDataAnalysis #WaterQuality #RiverPollution #DataScience #Python #Sustainability

## Description

This project analyzes toxin concentrations across five major global river systems (Yangtze, Nile, Mississippi, Danube, and Amazon) over a five-year period from 2018 to 2023.  
Using exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and visualization techniques, the project evaluates pollution patterns, compares toxin levels across rivers, and investigates relationships between water chemistry variables such as pH and heavy metals.

---

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to gain hands-on experience analyzing real-world environmental data and to better understand how industrialization, population density, and geography influence water quality in major river systems.

---

## Why this project was built

This project was built to explore how toxin concentrations vary across different rivers and over time, and to practice applying data analysis techniques to environmental monitoring data.  
It also aims to demonstrate how data-driven insights can inform environmental protection strategies and policy recommendations.

---

## Problem it solves

The project helps transform raw environmental monitoring data into actionable insights by:
- Identifying the most polluted river systems
- Comparing toxin concentrations across regions
- Analyzing trends in pollution over time
- Examining relationships between pH levels and toxic substances

## What I learned

Through this project, I learned how to:
- Clean and preprocess datasets with missing environmental measurements
- Perform exploratory data analysis using descriptive statistics
- Visualize environmental data using bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps
- Apply statistical methods such as correlation analysis, t-tests, and linear regression
- Interpret analytical results from an environmental and scientific perspective

## Overview

This project examines multiple water quality indicators, including:

- Lead  
- Mercury  
- Arsenic  
- pH Level  
- Temperature  
- Nitrates  
- Phosphates  
- Dissolved Oxygen  

The analysis focuses on comparing pollution levels across river systems and assessing how these variables change over time.

## Commonly asked questions

### 1. Which river is the most polluted?

The Yangtze River consistently shows the highest average concentrations of lead, mercury, and arsenic.  
This is likely due to its flow through densely populated and heavily industrialized regions.

---

### 2. Do toxin levels increase over time?

No significant long-term increase is observed between 2018 and 2023.  
Although short-term fluctuations occur, overall toxin levels remain relatively stable over the five-year period.

---

### 3. Is there a relationship between pH levels and toxin concentration?

A weak positive correlation exists between pH levels and lead concentration, while mercury and arsenic show very weak correlations.  
This suggests that pH has limited influence on toxin levels in these rivers.

---

### 4. How can this project be improved?

Possible improvements include:
- Adding more years of data
- Including additional river systems
- Applying seasonal or monthly trend decomposition
- Using geospatial visualization techniques
- Developing predictive models for future toxin levels

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values using mean imputation  
   - Converted date fields for time-series analysis  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Generated descriptive statistics  
   - Compared average toxin levels by river system  

3. **Visualization**  
   - Bar charts for average toxin concentrations  
   - Line graphs showing toxin levels over time  
   - Heatmaps for correlation analysis  

4. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - T-test comparing lead levels between the Amazon and Danube rivers  
   - Linear regression to model lead concentration based on pH levels  

---

## Results

- The Yangtze River is the most polluted among the rivers analyzed  
- The Amazon and Danube are the least polluted, likely due to lower industrial activity  
- No significant long-term increase in toxin levels is observed  
- Statistical testing confirms meaningful differences in pollution between certain rivers  

---

## Recommendations

- Strengthen industrial waste regulations along highly polluted rivers  
- Invest in wastewater treatment infrastructure near urban areas  
- Preserve ecosystems around low-pollution rivers such as the Amazon  
- Maintain regular monitoring and international cooperation for river health
